  Breaking systems ethically. Learning fast. Escalating always.

## 🕶️ About Me
I’m not here to build pretty websites.  
I’m here to **break**, **exploit**, **escalate**, and **understand systems from the inside out**.

No certificates (yet).  
No corporate training.  
Just **pure grind, discipline, and obsession with offensive security**.

I improve fast — faster than most people expect.

## ⚔️ My Arsenal — Tools I Build  
I don’t clone random tools.  
I **build my own weapons** — all from scratch.

### 🔥 CleanShot AI — *AI Fingerprint Destroyer*  
Anti-forensics. Metadata stripping.  
Adversarial perturbation to break AI detectors while keeping perfect image quality.

### 💀 WPA3-DEAD  
High-speed WiFi auditing. MDK-like floods. Automated attack chains.

### ⚡ Titan  
Lightweight but deadly Windows post-exploitation toolkit.  
Token stealing, enumeration, fast recon.

### ⚙️ Wordlists-Filter  
Smart & fast wordlist optimizer for real cracking workflows.

## 🩸 Real-World Hack — Cloud Firestore Compromise  
Not a lab. Not a simulation.  
A **real production website**, full access, full control — legally tested with permission.

I exploited:
- Exposed Firebase API Key  
- Weak client-side security model  
- Misconfigured Firestore Rules  
- No authentication on write  
- Read/Write access to live production data  
- Ability to modify metadata and deface portfolio images

Impact: **🔥 Critical – CVSS 9.9 (Broken Access Control)**  
Data integrity compromised.  
Report delivered. Patch deployed.

## 🐉 Active Directory Attacks I Own  
These are not just commands I memorized.  
I understand **why they work, how networks break, and how to chain them**.

### Attacks I’ve mastered recently:
- **LLMNR Poisoning**
- **IPv6 MITM (mitm6 → ntlmrelayx → secretsdump)**
- **Pass-the-Hash**
- **Pass-the-Ticket**
- **Kerberoasting**
- **Token Impersonation (Mimikatz + Incognito)**
- **Internal enumeration & post-exploitation**

Each one tested, understood, documented.

## 🔥 Currently Grinding
Right now I’m deep inside **Active Directory** — learning it the way attackers do.

Already mastered:
- LLMNR Poisoning  
- IPv6 MITM relay  
- Pass-the-Ticket  
- Pass-the-Hash  
- Kerberoasting  
- Token Impersonation  

Current focus:
- **Lateral Movement (pivoting chains)**  
- **Advanced AD exploitation techniques**  
- **Internal network mapping & privilege escalation paths**  
- **Payload development (BadUSB / Pico attacks)**  
- **Cloud misconfigurations and offensive cloud workflows**

I don’t study AD casually —  
I study it like someone preparing to **break an entire enterprise network**.

## 🐺 Personal Philosophy
> "If I touch a system, it becomes more secure —  
because I break it before anyone else does."
